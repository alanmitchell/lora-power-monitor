"""CircuitPython code to measure electrical power and transmit data via LoRaWAN.
The radio module used is a SEEED Studio Grove E5. Voltage is sampled from an 
Jameco 5VAC power adapter and current sampled from a CR Magnetics CR 3110-3000 CT.
Both current and voltage waveforms are connected to a 2.048 Volt reference voltage 
so that the AC voltage swing stays within limits of the microcontroller ADC.
